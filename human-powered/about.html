                            wheeled Human Powered Vehicle (HPV). The Cheetah held the world speed record for the 200
                            meter flying start event.</p>

                        <h3>Materials</h3>
                        <p>The Cheetah is predominantly constructed of carbon fiber composites with aluminum inserts
                            bonded in with Hysol adhesives. Bicycle components donated by Campagnolo included a
                            tensioned Kevlar rear disk wheel and a generous selection of alloy chainrings and
                            freewheels. Most other components were custom designed and fabricated by the Cheetah
                            Team. The aerodynamic fairing which encloses the rider of the Cheetah is also
                            constructed of carbon fiber composite. Aerodynamic design and advice was provided by
                            Michael Selig (currently an assistant professor of aeronautical engineering at the
                            University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne). The shape of the Cheetah was designed by
                            the Cheetah Team using a custom written Macintosh program. The Cheetah weighs in at 29.5
                            pounds complete with fairing and ready to ride.</p>

                        <h3>The Frame</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">The Cheetah's frame is a hollow monocoque design which is
                            constructed
                            with carbon fiber epoxy composite material. It has a large box section which
                            makes
                            the frame very stiff in a global sense despite the fact that locally, the
                            composite
                            is very thin. You can easily compress the frame's sides inwards 1/4 inch with
                            hand
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            In order to mount components to the Cheetah, honeycomb stiffening panels were
                            built
                            into the frame where needed. Additionally, at the front and rear ends of the
                            frame,
                            where the aluminum inserts were later bonded in, the composite was layered
                            thicker
                            to distribute the shock loading smoothly into the composite. The inserts
                            themselves
                            were also tapered to a thin edge to reduce the discontinuity in stress at the
                            edge
                            of the insert bonding surface.</p>

                        <h3>The Fairing</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">The Cheetah's fairing is a low drag aerodynamic shape. It was
                            designed
                            by fitting airfoil sections around interference measurements of the rider and
                            vehicle. Four separate airfoil sections are utilized in the design, each of
                            which
                            was custom created to optimize for low drag based on length, velocity, wobble,
                            and
                            air conditions anticipated at the record location. Other sections in the fairing
                            are
                            interpolations of these four optimized layers.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Michael Selig, Associate Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University
                            of
                            Illinois at Urbana Champagne, who at the time was an aerodynamics grad student
                            at
                            Penn State, optimized the airfoil sections based on the required sizes
                            determined by
                            the Cheetah Team. Using custom software written for the Macintosh by James
                            Osborn,
                            the sections were fit around the interference data. Changes in the desired
                            section
                            sizes were given back to Selig for further optimization. The result of this
                            iterative process is a very smooth low drag shape.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            The fairing was constructed out of carbon fiber epoxy composite material
                            utilizing a
                            multi-step process. First sections were cut precisely from Styrofoam slabs. A
                            male
                            master plug was created by stacking up these layers, gluing, smoothing, painting
                            and
                            buffing. Female molds were created from this master. And finally, the finished
                            fairings (one for training and one for record attempts) were fabricated using
                            these
                            molds.</p>

                        <h3>How Cheetah Runs</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">At the front end of the frame, a large hollow aluminum insert is
                            bonded
                            into the frame. This insert includes features for mounting the steering tube for
                            the
                            front forks, the bottom bracket (pedal spindle), and the front fairing mount.
                            The
                            insert was designed to be rigid and yet evenly disperse into the frame composite
                            itself the shock loading induced by pedaling and riding the Cheetah.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Similarly, at the rear of the frame, aluminum inserts are bonded
                            into
                            the frame to provide dropouts (rear wheel mounting locations) and rear fairing
                            mount
                            locations.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">An intermediate gearing assembly was custom designed and built to
                            step
                            up the gear ratio between the front chain ring and the rear freewheel cluster.
                            The
                            intermediate assembly accepts standard bicycle chainrings, but actually spins
                            upon a
                            pair of lightweight aircraft bearings, about a fixed shaft mounted to the frame.
                            The
                            front chain loop is fixed and does not shift, hence the Cheetah only has seven
                            speeds. With the intermediate gear assembly though, it is equivalent to using a
                            chainring with over 100 teeth on a conventional road bicycle! In fact the
                            Cheetah's
                            lowest speed is about the same as a road bike's top speed. This makes for tricky
                            starts since the rider is pedaling very slowly at first. This does not present a
                            problem for a professional cyclist and with the Cheetah's low drag, the rider is
                            able to "get on top of" that first gear in short order.</p>
